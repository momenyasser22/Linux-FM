# PyQt Linux File Manager

A simple file manager desktop application built with PyQt5.

## Code Overview

The main class is `FileExplorer` which handles initializing the UI and connecting signals to slots.

Key methods:

- `setup_ui` - Creates the layout, widgets, and buttons
- `list_directory_contents` - Populates the file list widget
- `handle_directory_double_click` - Handles navigating into folders
- `handle_open_button_click` - Opens selected files
- `go_back` - Navigates to previous folder in history
- `open_file` - Uses `xdg-open` to launch files
- `handle_delete_button_click` - Deletes selected files

The app keeps track of the current directory and maintains a history stack to enable back navigation.
